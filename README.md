# monopoly
This is a programme I'm working on to play Monopoly (the board game). I thought that there wasn't much agency or choice-making involved, so it might be possible to automate an entire game.

## Instructions (as of 22 May)
So monopoly_board.py is where all the action is at -- there's already a `game_start()` line in there so you just need to run the Python file. From there, you'll need to input the number of players, as well as the names of the players. From there, all you need to do is to press ENTER when prompted.

At the end of the game, there'll be a player report and a property report for you to see.

### Easter egg
See what happens when you refuse to enter a digit too many times when asked for the number of players hahaha.
